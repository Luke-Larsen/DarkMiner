# DarkMiner
 A program to use idle computer time to mine crypto
# This is the webscript for command and control
 This is mainly useful when you want to see if your machines are working and mining on pools or little statistics on how they are doing or total times.
 Due to the python migration I will not be uploading this tell it works with the python scripts which should be soon.
